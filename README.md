#HelloWorld
This a really basic java program. Just for messing around and trying out vim/eclim/tmux.

##Things I have learned so far
1. How to use tmux
2. How to use git
3. How to use vim
4. How to use markdown

#Learning Markdown (Github flavored)
```java
package org.text;

public class HelloWorld {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		hello();
	}
	public static void hello() {
		System.out.println("Hello world, how are you today?");
	}
}
```
